This report presents a structured analysis of a sample phishing email to identify common social engineering techniques, technical anomalies, and security red flags. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to detect malicious emails and contribute to improving organizational email security awareness.


Sample Email (Analyzed)

From: "Apple Support" <support@apple.com.secureverify-update.com>  
Subject: Urgent: Your Apple ID has been locked  

Dear Customer,

Your Apple ID has been locked due to security reasons.
We have detected a sign-in from an unknown device and an unusual activity from your account.
Please verify your identity within 24 hours or your account will be disabled due to concerns we have for the safety and integrity of the Apple Community.

Use this link https://αpple.com.verify-security-αccount-login.com  to verify your account.

Sincerely,
Apple Support




Analysis and Findings
Sender Email Address (Spoofing)
Email Displayed: https://αpple.com.verify-security-αccount-login.com
The sender's domain is crafted to mimic Apple’s official address. However, the root domain is secureverify-update.com, not apple.com.Also the  
'α' used here is a greek form which may seem similar to the original 'a'.This is a classic example of email spoofing using a lookalike domain to deceive the recipient.
Conclusion: Sender address is fraudulent and designed to exploit brand trust.






Header Discrepancies (Technical Inspection)
Tools Used: MXToolbox
Findings:Return-Path does not match the visible sender address.
SPF and DKIM records failed to authenticate.
Email originated from a hosting provider unassociated with Apple’s infrastructure.
(screenshot provided)
Conclusion: Header inconsistencies indicate a high likelihood of phishing.



Suspicious Links (Phishing Trap)
Displayed Link: https://αpple.com.verify-security-αccount-login.com 
Actual Domain: verify-security-account-login.com
The attacker embeds "αpple.com" as a subdomain to mislead the recipient.
Clicking this link likely redirects to a credential harvesting site.
Conclusion: URL is deceptive and designed to mimic Apple’s official login page.



Use of Urgent or Threatening Language
Language Used:
“Your Apple ID has been locked”
“Failure to act within 24 hours will result in permanent suspension”
The message creates a sense of urgency and fear, pressuring the user to act without thinking.
Conclusion: Email uses social engineering to elicit an emotional, impulsive response.




Mismatched URLs 
Hovering over the link reveals that the destination does not match the visual text.
This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as legitimate organizations typically use clean, branded URLs.
Conclusion:The mismatch is consistent with phishing attempts.





Grammar and Language Quality
The message lacks personalization (e.g., uses “Dear Customer” instead of a name).
Minor grammatical inconsistencies and awkward sentence structures suggest non-professional origin.
Conclusion: Language inconsistencies reduce authenticity and signal automation or foreign origin.
